//! # Audio resampling library
//!
//! Resampler is a small, zero-dependency crate for high-quality audio resampling between common
//! sample rates. It provides both FFT-based and FIR-based resamplers optimized for different use
//! cases.
//!
//! ## Usage Examples
//!
//! ### FFT-Based Resampler (Highest Quality)
//!
//! ```rust
//! use resampler::{ResamplerFft, SampleRate};
//!
//! // Create a stereo resampler (2 channels) from 44.1 kHz to 48 kHz.
//! let mut resampler = ResamplerFft::new(2, SampleRate::Hz44100, SampleRate::Hz48000);
//!
//! // Get required buffer sizes (already includes all channels).
//! let input_size = resampler.chunk_size_input();
//! let output_size = resampler.chunk_size_output();
//!
//! // Create input and output buffers (interleaved format: [L0, R0, L1, R1, ...]).
//! let input = vec![0.0f32; input_size];
//! let mut output = vec![0.0f32; output_size];
//!
//! resampler.resample(&input, &mut output).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! ### FIR-Based Resampler (Low Latency, Streaming)
//!
//! ```rust
//! use resampler::{Attenuation, Latency, ResamplerFir, SampleRate};
//!
//! // Create a stereo resampler with configurable latency (16, 32, or 64 samples).
//! let mut resampler = ResamplerFir::new(
//!     2,
//!     SampleRate::Hz48000,
//!     SampleRate::Hz44100,
//!     Latency::Sample64,
//!     Attenuation::Db90,
//! );
//!
//! // Streaming API - accepts arbitrary input buffer sizes.
//! let input = vec![0.0f32; 512];
//! let mut output = vec![0.0f32; resampler.buffer_size_output()];
//!
//! let (consumed, produced) = resampler.resample(&input, &mut output).unwrap();
//! println!("Consumed {consumed} samples, produced {produced} samples");
//! ```
//!
//! ## Choosing a Resampler
//!
//! Both resamplers provide good quality, but are optimized for different use cases:
//!
//! | Feature     | [`ResamplerFft`]                 | [`ResamplerFir`]             |
//! |-------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
//! | Quality     | Very good (sharp rolloff)        | Good (slow rolloff)          |
//! | Performance | Very fast                        | Fast (configurable)          |
//! | Latency     | ~256 samples                     | 16-64 samples (configurable) |
//! | API         | Fixed chunk size                 | Flexible streaming           |
//! | Best for    | Non-latency sensitive processing | Low-latency processing       |
//!
//! Use [`ResamplerFft`] when:
//! - You need the absolute highest quality
//! - Latency is not a concern
//! - Processing pre-recorded audio files
//!
//! Use [`ResamplerFir`] when:
//! - You need low latency (real-time audio)
//! - You can live with a slower rolloff
//! - Working with streaming data
//!
//! ## FFT-Based Implementation
//!
//! The resampler uses an FFT-based overlap-add algorithm with Kaiser windowing for high-quality
//! audio resampling. Key technical details:
//!
//! - Custom mixed-radix FFT with the Stockham Autosort algorithm.
//! - SIMD optimizations: All butterflies have SSE2, SSE4.2, AVX+FMA, and ARM NEON implementations.
//! - Stopband attenuation of -100 dB using the Kaiser windows function.
//! - Latency around 256 samples.
//!
//! ## FIR-Based Implementation
//!
//! The FIR resampler uses a polyphase filter with linear interpolation for high-quality audio
//! resampling with low latency. Key technical details:
//!
//! - Polyphase decomposition: 1024 phases with linear interpolation between phases.
//! - SIMD optimizations: Convolution kernels optimized with SSE2, SSE4.2, AVX+FMA, AVX-512
//!   and ARM NEON.
//! - Configurable filter length: 32, 64, or 128 taps (16, 32, or 64 samples latency).
//! - Adjustable rolloff and stopband attenuation,
//! - Streaming API: Accepts arbitrary input buffer sizes for flexible real-time processing,
//!
//! ## Performance
//!
//! Both resamplers include SIMD optimizations with runtime CPU feature detection for maximum
//! performance and compatibility.
//!
//! But for up to 25% better performance on x86_64, compile with `target-cpu=x86-64-v3`
//! (enables AVX2, FMA, and other optimizations).
//!
//! Overall the SIMD for x86_64 have four levels implemented, targeting four possible CPU
//! generations that build up on each other:
//!
//!  * x86-64-v1: 128-bit SSE2 (around 2003-2004)
//!  * x86-64-v2: 128-bit SSE4.2 (around 2008-2011)
//!  * x86-64-v3: 256-bit AVX+FMA (around 2013-2015)
//!  * x86-64-v4: 512-bit AVX-512 (around 2017-2022)
